# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates.

| Version   | Supported          |
| --------- | ------------------ |
| Versions? | :white_check_mark: |

I don't have versions since this is a discord bot why would it need a specific version number that people can refer to

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Make an issue and I'll hopefully look at it (if it is really an important security vulnerability anyway)
